🩺 Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project investigates how dataset balance, image augmentation, and early stopping affect deep learning performance in skin cancer classification.

Four models were evaluated on balanced and imbalanced datasets using dermoscopy images.

📌 Models Used

AlexNet

VGG11

ResNet50

Vision Transformer (ViT)

📂 Datasets

ISIC Balanced Dataset

ISIC 2016 Dataset

Both datasets were used for binary classification (Benign vs Malignant).

⚙️ Methodology

Framework: PyTorch

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Binary Cross Entropy

Augmentation: Horizontal Flip, Color Jitter

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC

32 experiments were conducted with different combinations of:

With / Without augmentation

With / Without early stopping

📊 Key Results

Balanced datasets produced significantly better results.

ResNet and VGG performed best overall.

Image augmentation had limited impact.

Early stopping reduced training time but sometimes lowered performance.
