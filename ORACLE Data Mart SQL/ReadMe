📊 Oracle Data Mart for a theatre company in London (92%)
This repository contains Bo Kwok's Individual Portfolio Project for the coursework titled Design and Coding, submitted for unit 6G6Z0026_2425_9. The project presents the design and implementation of a prototype Oracle Data Mart for a theatre company in London, focusing on ticket sales performance analysis.

🧩 Data Mart Overview
A Snowflake Schema is adopted for the  Data Mart, centered around a Sales Fact table and supported by six dimension tables:

Theatre

Production

Performance

Customer

Date

(Optional future addition: Staff)

Key Schema Decisions:
Normalized schema to avoid data redundancy.

Surrogate keys for efficient joins.

Date dimension included for time-series analysis.

Staff data is excluded due to irrelevance to ticket sales metrics.

🛠 Tables & Attributes
🔹 Sales Fact Table
Primary Key: SalesFactNo

Foreign Keys: TheatreNo, ProductionNo, PerformanceNo, CustomerID, DateID

Attributes: PaymentMethod, DeliveryMethod, TotalAmount

🔹 Dimension Tables
Theatre: TheatreName, TheatreAddress, MainTel
Production: ProductionTitle, ProductionDirector, PlayAuthor
Performance: pDate, pHour, pMinute, Comments
Customer: CustomerTitle, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, TelNo, Email
Date: FullDate, Year, Month, Day

🔧 Future Expansions
Add ServiceCharge, DiscountAmount, and TotalTickets to Sales Fact.

Add capacity and operational cost data to Theatre.

Add duration to Production.

Track customer lifetime value.

Add fiscal periods and quarters to Date.

Introduce a Staff dimension for HR analytics.

🧪 SQL Implementation
All SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO commands are included, executed successfully in Oracle APEX 22.1.

Data types validated with CHECK constraints.

Referential integrity enforced.

Sample records included for each table.

📈 Analytical Queries
Four analytical queries were designed and tested:

Yearly Total Sales per Theatre

Uses ROLLUP for yearly and grand totals.

Average Monthly Sales per Theatre

Uses CUBE to identify seasonal trends.

Frequent Customers Analysis

Identifies customers who visited LTC in 4+ distinct months in a year.

Top Grossing Productions

Uses RANK() to find productions with highest total sales.

Each query is explained, justified, and backed with results.
