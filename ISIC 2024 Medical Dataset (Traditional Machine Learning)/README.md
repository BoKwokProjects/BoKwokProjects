# Machine Learning on ISIC 2024 Dataset  
### Chaos and Clues Algorithm Approach

This project applies traditional machine learning techniques to the **ISIC 2024 Challenge Dataset** for skin lesion classification, inspired by the *Chaos and Clues* diagnostic algorithm.

The main objective is to evaluate traditional machine learning models using curated metadata features to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions.
