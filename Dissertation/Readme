ðŸ§  Dissertation: Skin Lesion Classification using ML & DL
This project presents a comparative study of traditional machine learning and deep learning methods for classifying skin lesions, leveraging the ISIC 2024 SLICE-3D dataset. The dataset uniquely combines dermoscopic images with 3D physical lesion metadataâ€”enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both image-based and structured-data models.

The work involves:

Implementing and tuning six traditional ML models: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost.

Developing and testing four deep learning models: AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG11, and Vision Transformer (ViT).

Using Google Colab for model development, training, and evaluation.

Comparing models across multiple metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

Key Insight:
Traditional machine learning modelsâ€”especially gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoostâ€”outperformed deep learning counterparts in this study. XGBoost achieved 88.5% test accuracy and 88.1% F1 score, while deep learning models underperformed due to dataset size and computational constraints.
