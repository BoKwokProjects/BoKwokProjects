Big Data: A comprehensive big data project using PySpark, Kafka, Spark, and Hadoop to analyze Amazon review data through statistical hypothesis testing and to build a real-time weather data pipeline with OpenWeatherAPI. The project demonstrates large-scale data processing, machine learning integration, and distributed storage in cloud-based environments.

C#: Contains projects developed using the C# programming language.

Final Year Dissertation on Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning using the ISIC 2024 Dataset: A comparative study analyzing the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for skin lesion classification using the ISIC 2024 SLICE-3D dataset. 

ISIC 2024 Medical Dataset (Traditional Machine Learning)/: A metadata-driven skin lesion classification project using traditional machine learning models inspired by the Chaos and Clues diagnostic approach, achieving up to 90.8% accuracy with Random Forest in distinguishing benign from malignant cases.

ISIC Balanced Split Medical Dataset (Deep Learning)/: 
A comparative study of AlexNet, VGG11, ResNet50, and Vision Transformer models on balanced and imbalanced ISIC dermoscopy datasets to classify benign and malignant skin lesions. 

ORACLE Data Mart SQL: Designed and implemented a Snowflake-schema Oracle Data Mart to analyze ticket sales performance, featuring validated SQL tables, referential integrity, and advanced analytical queries using ROLLUP, CUBE, and RANK functions. The project delivers insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and top-performing productions through a fully tested Oracle APEX implementation.
